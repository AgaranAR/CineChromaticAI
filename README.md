## 🌈 Key Features

- 🎭 **Genre-Based Primary Palette**  
  Detects movie genre from script and applies an appropriate base color palette (e.g., bluish for sci-fi, dark tones for thrillers).

- 😢 **Emotion-Aware Scene Tweaks**  
  Uses pre-trained emotion detection models to subtly adapt colors in each scene based on the dominant emotion.

- 🎞️ **Frame-by-Frame Processing**  
  Cuts video into frames, analyzes them, and reassembles with enhanced coloring.

- 🧠 **Powered by AI**  
  Utilizes NLP (Gemini AI) for script analysis and models like AffectNet for emotion detection.
